1|private nitrate|Private Nitrate Interpretation|If the nitrate concentration in this sample is less than or equal to 45 mg/L (as NO3), this level does NOT exceed the infant health advisory level. If the nitrate concentration in this sample is greater than 45 mg/L (as NO3), this level EXCEEDS the infant health advisory level and should NOT be used to prepare formula or used for drinking by infants less than six months of age. These levels pose a health risk to bottle-fed infants by reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (rare disorder called methemoglobinemia). Contact your local county health department or SHL's web site (http://www.shl.uiowa.edu; click on Well Water in the left hand menu) for information and guidance to help correct your water quality problem. "Quant limit" refers to the lowest level the method can accurately detect.
2|private total colifo|Private Total Coliform Interpretation|If the total coliform bacteria and E.coli test results are "Absent" or "<1", these results are satisfactory and the water is bacterially safe for drinking purposes. If the total coliform bacteria test is "Present" or number is greater than or equal to 1 (e.g. 1, 20.7, 50.4, >200.5, etc), this result is UNSATISFACTORY and indicates the water is bacterially UNSAFE and should NOT be used for drinking unless properly disinfected before use (e.g. boiling for one minute). In addition, if the E.coli bacteria test result is also "Present" or number is greater than or equal to 1, this result indicates the water may be contaminated by human or animal sewage. E.coli presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with microorganisms that CAN cause disease and thus, represents a serious health concern. Contact your local county health department or SHL's web site (http://www.shl.uiowa.edu; click on Well Water in the left hand menu) for information and guidance to help correct your water quality problem.
3|sdwa total coliform|SDWA Total Coliform|If the total coliform bacteria and E.coli tests are reported "Absent" or "<1," these results are SATISFACTORY. If the total coliform bacteria test is "Present" or is a number greater than or equal to 1.0 (for example 1.0, 20.7, 50.4, >200.5. etc), this result is UNSATISFACTORY. All compliance results have been reported to IDNR as required. If a "routine" sample result is total coliform Present, state regulations require more sample collection and these sample containers (labeled as "repeat" sample type) have been mailed to your facility for this purpose. If a "repeat" sample result is total coliform Present, you should contact IDNR to inquire if public notification or additional sampling will be required. If a "repeat" or triggered source water sample is total coliform AND E.coli Present, you should contact IDNR IMMEDIATELY for public notification, corrective action, or additional sampling requirements since these results represent a serious health concern.

84|pfge nosocom|PFGE (nosocomial)|"In practice, typing is most effective as an aid to outbreak investigations when it is applied to small sets of isolates that are epidemiologically related. The isolates should be obtained from patients, fomites, and environmental sources that are related to (i) the area in which infections are occurring, (ii) the period during which the infections occurred, and (iii) a common source of infection. Typing studies performed on isolates for which epidemiologic information is not and will not be available may produce misleading information. Strain typing data do not substitute for epidemiologic data. Rather, the two data sets should be developed independently but analyzed together to determine whether an outbreak has occurred."1 A batch report for the submitted isolates will follow. Citation: 1.

85|picornavirus|Picornavirus Antibody (Echo, Entero, Coxsackie)|Titers of >= 1:8 are presumptive evidence of active or recent infection. The Complement Fixation test does not differentiate between IgG and IgM antibodies. Low titers are generally associated with mild diseases while high or rising titers are usually associated with progressive or severe disease. A fourfold rise or decline in titer of acute and convalescent sera is diagnostic of an immune response. An acute blood specimen collected as soon as possible after onset of illness should be followed in 14-21 days by a convalescent serum.
86|q fever igg|Q-Fever IgG Antibody|Titers of >= 1:16 to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 antigens are positive and suggest C. burnetii infection. Phase 1 antibody titers >= Phase 2 antibody titers are consistent with chronic infection. Titers of < 1:16 to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 antigens are negative and no antibody was detected. If acute Q-Fever is suspected, obtain a second serum sample 2-3 weeks after the acute sample. Titers of >= 1:256 to Phase 2 antigen only indicate evidence of recent or active C. burnetii infection. Titers of < 1:256 indicate no specific antibody was detected.
87|rmsf igg|Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever IgG|Titers of < 1:64 indicate no antibody detected. Single IgG serum endpoint titers >= 1:64 and < 1:256 are suggestive of infection at an undetermined time and may be indicative of either past infection or early response to a recent infection. The best serological evidence of recent Rickettsial infection is a 4-fold or greater increase in IgG titer between 2 serum samples drawn 1 to 2 weeks apart and tested in parallel. IgG serum endpoint titers of >= 1:256 are considered presumptive evidence of recent or current infection by organisms of the appropriate Rickettsial antigen group.
88|rubella igg|Rubella IgG|A Negative result indicates no antibody to Rubella IgG detected. Such individuals are presumed to be uninfected with Rubella and to be susceptible to primary infection. A Positive result indicates antibody to Rubella IgG was detected. An Equivocal result should follow with a second sample in 2-3 weeks.
89|rubella igm|Rubella IgM|A Negative result indicates no significant level of detectable IgM antibody to Rubella. A Positive result indicates a significant level of detectable IgM antibody to Rubella and current or recent infection. An Equivocal result should be followed by a second sample in 7 days.
90|rubeola igg|Rubeola (Measles) IgG|A Negative result indicates no antibody to Measles IgG was detected. Such individuals are presumed to be uninfected with Measles and susceptible to primary infection. An Equivocal result should be retested using a second sample. Recommend a convalescent sample in 14-21 days. A Positive result indicates the presence of IgG antibody to Measles from a current or previous infection. The individual may be at risk of transmitting Measles infection, but is not necessarily currently contagious.
91|rubeola igm|rubeola (Measles) IgM|A Negative result indicates no significant level of detectable IgM antibody to Measles. A Positive result indicates a significant level of detectable IgM antibody to Measles and current or recent infection. An Equivocal result should be followed by a second sample in 14-21 days.
92|arbo sle igm|St. Louis Encephalitis IgM Antibody|A Positive Arbovirus IgM antibody result indicates recent or active infection by the appropriate virus group. A Negative Arbovirus IgM antibody result indicates no antibody was detected at this time. An Indeterminate result indicates non-specific fluorescence was seen and this sample will be sent to CDC for further testing.
93|toxoplasma|Toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM|A Negative test result indicates no antibody present to T. gondii. A positive test result indicates presence of antibody to T. gondii. Positive results are followed by IgM antibody specific testing for confirmation of a current infection.
94|toxoplasma igm|Toxoplasmosis IgM|A Negative IgM antibody result indicates no IgM antibody present. A Positive IgM antibody result indicates recent infection with T. gondii.
95|tularemia|Tularemia IgG and IgM|Titers of < 1:20 are negative for antibody to Francisella tularensis. Titers of 1:20-1:80 indicate prior exposure to tularemia and repeat testing in 14-21 days is recommended. Titers of >= 1:160 are strongly suggestive of an infection and repeat testing is recommended in 14-21 days. A fourfold rise/change in titer in paired sera is diagnostic.
96|arbo wee igm|Western Equine Encephalitis IgM Antibody|A Positive Arbovirus IgM antibody result indicates recent or active infection by the appropriate virus group. A Negative Arbovirus IgM antibody result indicates no antibody was detected at this time. An Indeterminate result indicates non-specific fluorescence was seen and this sample will be sent to CDC for further testing.
97|wnv igm|West Nile Virus IgM Antibody|A Negative result indicates no significant level of detectable IgM antibody to West Nile Virus. A Positive result indicates a significant level of detectable IgM antibody to West Nile Virus and current or recent infection. An Equivocal result should be followed by a second sample in 14-21 days.
98|tb qftg|QuantiFERON TB Gold|The TB-Antigen minus NIL value represents lymphocyte reactivity. A Negative result (<0.35 IU/mL) does not rule out TB infection. A Positive result (>= 0.35 IU/mL) does not differentiate active from latent tuberculosis. An Indeterminate result indicates responsiveness to M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7 and no conclusive interpretation can be made. See CDC guidelines for diagnosing and treating TB disease.
99|syphilis tppa|Syphilis TPPA|A Nonreactive result indicates no past or present infection, but during early incubating-stage syphilis a Non-Reactive result may also occur. A Reactive treponemal test indicates past or present infection and usually remains reactive for life. A Inconclusive/Indeterminate result should be followed by a second sample in two weeks. Interpretation of results obtained with the TP-PA syphilis antibody test must be used in conjunction with the patient's clinical symptoms, medical history and other clinical and/or laboratory findings.
100|syphilis vdrl serum|Syphilis VDRL Serum|A Nonreactive VDRL result indicates no current or past evidence of syphilis infection. A Reactive VDRL result (a quantitative titer will be also performed) may indicate past or present infection, and will be followed with a TPPA for confirmation.
101|syphilis vdrl csf|Syphilis VDRL CSF|A Nonreactive VDRL test on CSF may indicate that the patient does not have neurosyphilis. A Reactive VDRL result on CSF suggests past or present syphilis infection of the central nervous system.
102|giardia crypto ms|Giardia and Crypto Matrix Spike|The recommended acceptance criteria for Method 1623.1 Cryptosporidium and Giardia matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate mean percent recoveries are >31% and >7%, respectively. Some sample matrices may prevent this acceptance criteria from being met when all other quality control is acceptable.
