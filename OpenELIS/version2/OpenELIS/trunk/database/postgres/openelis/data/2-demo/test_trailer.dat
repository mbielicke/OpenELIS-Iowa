1|private total colifo|Private Total Coliform Interpretation|If the total coliform bacteria and E.coli test results are "Absent" or "<1", these results are satisfactory and the water is bacterially safe for drinking purposes.  If the total coliform bacteria test is "Present" or number is greater than or equal to 1 (e.g. 1, 20.7, 50.4, >200.5, etc),  this result is UNSATISFACTORY and indicates the water is bacterially UNSAFE and should NOT be used for drinking unless properly disinfected before use (e.g. boiling for one minute).  In addition, if the E.coli bacteria test result is also "Present" or number is greater than or equal to 1, this result indicates the water may be contaminated by human or animal sewage.  E.coli presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with microorganisms that CAN cause disease and thus, represents a serious health concern.

2|private nitrate|Private Nitrate Interpretation|If the nitrate concentration in this sample is less than or equal to 45 mg/L (as NO3), this level does NOT exceed the infant health advisory level.  If the nitrate concentration in this sample is greater than 45 mg/L (as NO3), this level EXCEEDS the infant health advisory level and should NOT be used to prepare formula or used for drinking by infants less than six months of age. These levels pose a health risk to bottle-fed infants by reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (rare disorder called methemoglobinemia).  Contact your local county health department or SHL's web site ( http://www.uhl.uiowa.edu; click on Well Water in the left hand menu ) for information and guidance to help correct your water quality problem. "Quant limit" refers to the lowest level the method can accurately detect.
3|epa 00-02 method|why epa method 00-02 was used and MCL|This method was performed to eliminate interference from dissolved solids that prevent the use of the screening method, EPA 900.0.  This EPA 00-02 method is more labor intensive, thus the cost is higher. If the "Gross Alpha including Uranium"  result is less than 15 pCi/L,  for Iowa water supplies, the result will be considered the same as "Gross Alpha excluding Uranium". If the result is greater than 15 pCi/L then a "Gross Alpha excluding Uranium"  test is also performed.  The EPA has designated a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 15 pCi/L for "Gross Alpha excluding Uranium" for public drinking water supplies. The MCL (is only applicable to compliance monitoring samples under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).
4|epa 900.0 beta|beta screening for Photon MCL|Gross Beta is a screening test to see if specific beta/photon emitter testing needs to be performed for samples submitted for SDWA compliance monitoring.  If the gross beta result is greater than 50 pCi/L then testing for individual radionuclide isotopes will be performed.  They will be reported in units of mrem/yr to determine compliance with the photon MCL (maximum contaminate level) of 4 mrem/yr.

6|sdwa total coliform|SDWA Total Coliform|If the total coliform bacteria and E.coli tests are reported "Absent" or "<1," these results are SATISFACTORY.  If the total coliform bacteria test is "Present" or is a number greater than or equal to 1.0 (for example 1.0, 20.7, 50.4, >200.5. etc), this result is UNSATISFACTORY.  All compliance results have been reported to IDNR as required.  If a "routine" sample result is total coliform Present, state regulations require more sample collection and these sample containers (labeled as "repeat" sample type) have been mailed to your facility for this purpose.  If a "repeat" sample result is total coliform Present, you should contact IDNR to inquire if public notification or additional sampling will be required. If a "repeat" or triggered source water sample is total coliform AND E.coli Present, you should contact IDNR IMMEDIATELY for public notification, corrective action, or additional sampling requirements since these results represent a serious health concern.

84|pfge nosocom|PFGE (nosocomial)|“In practice, typing is most effective as an aid to outbreak investigations when it is applied to small sets of isolates that are epidemiologically related. The isolates should be obtained from patients, fomites, and environmental sources that are related to (i) the area in which infections are occurring, (ii) the period during which the infections occurred, and (iii) a common source of infection. Typing studies performed on isolates for which epidemiologic information is not and will not be available may produce misleading information. Strain typing data do not substitute for epidemiologic data. Rather, the two data sets should be developed independently but analyzed together to determine whether an outbreak has occurred.”1 A batch report for the submitted isolates will follow. Citation: 1.

87|qftg|QuantiFERON TB Gold|Positive: M. tuberculosis infection likely. Negative: M. tuberculosis infection unlikely, but cannot be excluded especially when: 1. Any illness is consistent with TB disease, 2. Likelihood of progression to disease (e.g., because of immunosuppression) is increased. Indeterminate: Results are indeterminate for responsiveness to M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT-6 or CFP-10 and no conclusive interpretation can be reached. All test results require a combination of epidemiological, historical, medical, and diagnostic findings that should be taken into account when interpreting test results. Note: The intended use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay is to detect latent TB infections among persons at increased risk for TB. The ability of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to predict the progression of latent tuberculosis infection to active tuberculosis has not been evaluated.

91|rmsf ifa|Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever by IFA|<1:64 = No antibody detected. >=1:64 to <1:256 = Single IgG serum endpoint titers which are suggestive of infection at an undetermined time and may be indicative of either past infection or early response to a recent infection. The best serological evidence of recent Rickettsial infection is a 4-fold or greater increase in IgG titer between 2 serum samples drawn 1 to 2 weeks apart and tested in parallel. >=1:256 = IgG serum endpoint titers of 1:256 and greater are considered presumptive evidence of recent or current infection by organisms of the appropriate Rickettsial antigen group.
93|rubeola igg|Rubeola (Measles) IgG|Measles (rubeola) IgG is a qualitative test using an enzyme-linked immunoassay method (ELFA). A negative result indicates no significant level of detectable measles (rubeola) IgG antibody present (patients with a current primary infection may not begin producing measurable IgG until several days after infection). An equivocal result requires a repeat sample submitted in 10-14 days. A positive result may indicate a current or past exposure/immunization to measles (rubeola). Positive IgG antibody levels in the absence of current clinical symptoms may indicate immunity.
94|ruo|RUO|This test is for research purposes only.  It has NOT been validated and its performance characteristics have not been determined by the University Hygienic Laboratory.
95|ruo flu|RUO Flu|This virus has been strain typed as a H1 or H3 for surveillance purposes. This test is for research purposes only.
96|sequencing|Sequencing|This test was adopted for use and its performance characteristics determined by the State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The State Hygienic Laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
98|shiga toxin|Shiga toxin Screen|A positive Shiga toxin screen result indicates the detection of free toxin only. A culture will be performed to confirm isolation of a Shiga toxin producing E. coli organism. A negative result indicates either the absence of Shiga toxin or toxin levels lower than the test is able to detect. CDC recommends screening for the presence of Shiga toxin on all stools submitted for culture.
100|toxo comp|Toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM by Competitive|=>1.7 = Negative for antibody to T. gondii. <=1.6 = Positive for antibody to T. gondii. All positive screens are tested using an IgM specific assay.
101|toxo igm|Toxoplasmosis IgM by ELFA (mini Vidas)|<=0.54 = Negative for IgM antibody to T. gondii. 0.55-0.64 = Equivocal, suggest repeat testing in 14-21 days. >=0.65 = Positive for antibody to T. gondii. IgM antibody indicates recent infection.
104|tularemia|Tularemia IgG by Tube Agglutination|<1:20 = Negative. 1:20-1:40 = Indicates prior exposure to tularemia. Suggest repeat testing in 14-21 days. =>1:80 is diagnostic. Suggest repeat testing in 14-21 days. A fourfold rise/change in titer in paired sera is diagnostic.
105|uhl pcr|Disclaimer for UHL PCR test|Please note that a "not detected" result does not rule out the presence of the microbe in the sample but could mean that the microbes nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) was in concentrations below the level of detection by the assay. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests performed have been developed and their performance characteristics determined by the University Hygienic Laboratory. These PCR tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
