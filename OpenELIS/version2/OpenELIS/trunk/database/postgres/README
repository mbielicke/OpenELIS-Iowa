This script is used to create and load the inital database for openelis
and security. The openelis database contains all the information for the
laboratory system while the security database contains permissions
(authorization) records for system users.

The following steps can be used to create develpment, test, or production
databases depending on need. Our convention is to append "_dev" or "_test"
after the database name for development and test; production database just
used "openelis" or "security".

The two subdirectories contain the schema and inital data load files
for each database. The following are steps used to create each database
(openelis_dev, openelis_test, openelis, security_dev, ...) on a LINUX
system:

1. Download and install postgres 9.1.10 or later

2. Download and install pgAdminIII

3. switch to postgres user
    a. $ su - postgres

4. Create users in postgres database; each will need a password and you
   will need to enter the jboss_dev password in to JBOSS database connection

    a. createuser -P -s dba                  (user will own the databases)
    b. createuser -P -D -i -R -S jboss_dev   (user from JBOSS devlopment server)

5. Create databases

    a. createdb -O dba security_test 'Security test database'
    b. createdb -O dba openelis_test 'OpenELIS test database'

6. Create the tables in security database; you can use the pgAdminIII or
   use command line psql -- following is the instructions for for psql

    a. cd openelis/postgres/security
    b. psql security_test
    c. at 'security_test=#' type the following one at a time
       \i tables.sql
       \i indexes.sql
       \i permissions.sql
       \q

    d. cd data
    e. cd 0-initial
    f. psql security_test
    g. at 'security_test=#' type the following
       \i load.sql
       \q

    h. if you want to load the user 'demo' which you will need to play with
       the server, cd to 1-demo-user and re-do steps f-g

7. Create the tables in openelis database; you can use the pgAdminIII or
   use command line psql -- following is the instructions for for psql

    a. cd openelis/postgres/openelis
    b. psql openelis_test
    c. at 'openelis_test=#' type the following one at a time
       \i tables.sql
       \i indexes.sql
       \i permissions.sql
       \q

    d. cd data
    e. cd 0-initial
    f. psql openelis_test
    g. at 'openelis_test=#' type the following
       \i load.sql
       \q

    h. if you want to load a list of our analytes, cd to
       1-analytes and re-do steps f-g

    h. if you want to load a list of our tests, sections, etc., cd to
       2-demo and re-do steps f-g

8. At this point all your databases are created and loaded
