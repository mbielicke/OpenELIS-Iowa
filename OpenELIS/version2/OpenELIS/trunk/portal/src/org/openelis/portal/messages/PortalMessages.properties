#Final Report
finalReport.help.screen = <span class=\"helpText\"><span class=\"helpHeader\">Locating Your Results</span><br/><p/>You only need to enter information in one field to conduct a search for your results. Examples include: <b>Collected Date</b>, <b>Accession Number</b>, <b>Collector Name</b>, or <b>Patient''s Last Name</b><p/>It is recommended that you use the calendar to the right of each date field when entering a date to eliminate any formatting errors. You must click out of the calendar to enter the selected date. All dates have the format of YYYY-MM-DD. Released Date also includes the time in the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.<p/>You may also narrow your search by entering information in multiple fields. For example, to find all of the samples that you collected and sent to the laboratory in June of 2014, enter your name (as it appeared on the collection form) in the <b>Collector Name</b> field and select (using the calendars provided) 2014-06-01 in the <b>Collected Date</b> field and 2014-06-30 in the <b>To</b> field.<p/>The system supports wild card searches in the following fields: <b>Client Reference</b>, <b>Collector Name</b>, <b>PWS ID</b>, <b>Patient''s First Name</b>, and <b>Patient''s Last Name</b>. By using this search method you would add an * at the beginning and/or end of your search term. <p/>For example, to see a list of patient results for a patient whose last name starts with the letters <i>schm</i>, enter <i>schm*</i> in the <b>Patient''s Last Name</b> field.
