These instructions are used to create and load the initial database for openelis
and security. The openelis database contains all the information for the
laboratory system while the security database contains permissions
(authorization) records for system users.

The following steps can be used to create development, test, or production
databases depending on need. Our convention is to append "_dev" or "_test"
after the database name for development and test; production database just
used "openelis" or "security".

The two subdirectories contain the schema and inital data load files
for each database. The following are steps used to create each database
(openelis_dev, openelis_test, openelis, security_dev, ...) on a LINUX
system:

1. Download and install postgres 9.1.10 or later

2. Download and install pgAdminIII

3. switch to postgres user
    a. $ su - postgres

4. Create users in postgres database; each will need a password and you
   will need to enter the jboss_dev password in to JBOSS database connection

    a. createuser -P -s dba                  (user will own the databases)
    b. createuser -P -D -i -R -S jboss_dev   (user from JBOSS devlopment server)

5. Create databases

    a. createdb -O dba security_test 'Security test database'
    b. createdb -O dba openelis_test 'OpenELIS test database'

6. Create the tables in security database. The load step creates all
   the necessary module entries for Security and OpenELIS databases.
   It also adds 2 users: "system" and "admin". User "system" is required
   for OpenELIS background system processes; it is not an interactive
   account and does not need authentication records in LDAP or AD.
   User "admin" is used to add users to Security and perform system
   setup on OpenELIS. It does require a matching LDAP/AD authenticated user
   however, "admin" can be changed to another name to match an existing user.  
 
    a. cd openelis/postgres/security
    b. psql security_test
    c. at 'security_test=#' type the following one at a time
       \i tables.sql
       \i indexes.sql
       \i procedures.sql
       \i permissions.sql
       \q

    d. cd data
    e. cd 0-initial
    f. psql security_test
    g. at 'security_test=#' type the following
       \i load.sql
       \q
	
	h. OPTIONAL: if you want to change "admin" to another user
	   psql security_test
	   update system_user set login_name = '<YOUR LDAP USER NAME>' where login_name = 'admin';
	   \q

    i. OPTIONAL: The following step will provide you with example
       data for test environment. SKIP THIS STEP FOR PRODUCTION
       cd to 1-demo and re-do steps f-g

7. Create the tables in openelis database

    a. cd openelis/postgres/openelis
    b. psql openelis_test
    c. at 'openelis_test=#' type the following one at a time
       \i tables.sql
       \i views.sql
       \q

    d. cd data
    e. cd 0-initial
    f. psql openelis_test
    g. at 'openelis_test=#' type the following
       \i load.sql
       \q

8. OPTIONAL: following steps will provide you with example
   data for test environment. 
   
    a. if you want to load a list of our analytes, cd to
       1-analytes and re-do steps f-g

    b. if you want to load a list of our tests, sections, etc., cd to
       2-demo and re-do steps f-g

9. Create indices and apply permission
    c. cd openelis/postgres/openelis
    d. psql openelis_test
    e. at 'openelis_test=#' type the following one at a time
       \i indexes.sql
       \i permissions.sql
       \q

At this point all your databases are created and loaded
