1. Right click on the project and go to properties to set up the annotation processing.
   Use screenshots annotation-step-1 & 2

2. Delete the *Service and *ServiceIntAsync files in client package.

3. Rename *ServiceInt to just be *Service

4. Add the @Service annotation to the in the *Service interface, import it from the UI project. 

5. After saving the file the *ServiceAsync and *ServiceImpl files will be created.
   You will not see them in your workspace, however, they will reside in the .apt-generated
   source folder.

6. You will also see a validation error on the *Service interface complaining about the GWT
   validation not finding the Async version. You can just set the validator to ignore this
   since we will always create it. There is a screenshot (annotation-step-3) to do this.

7. The *ServiceImpl is now created as an enum Singleton. To use it in the screen just use

   *ServiceImpl.INSTANCE.method();

   Or set an instance variable 

   *ServiceImpl service = *ServiceImpl.INSTANCE;
